The starting point for learning python is pandas. A small example is given below on opening of file in jupyter notebook. Documentation for pandas can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/





```python

import pandas as pd

pd.read_csv('name of file.csv') #pd is the handle on pandas

```
